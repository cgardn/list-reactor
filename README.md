### A Trello clone in React

A digital day planner intended to be more calendar focused than Trello, but faster and with a more intuitive UX than Google Calendar.

Rather bare bones at the moment, but planned features include:
- actual calendar-related things (events, reminders, viewing future weeks)
- aesthetics
- mobile app with React Native
