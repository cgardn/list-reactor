# List Reactor
### A Trello clone in React

This started as a way to learn React, but it's evolving into a TODO-app that has all the things I need. The design intent is to eventually be a digital day-planner - more calendar focused than Trello, and better UX than Google Calendar.

Rather bare bones at the moment, but planned features include:
- actual calendar-related things
- draggable list items with the HTML drag-and-drop API
- mobile app with React Native
